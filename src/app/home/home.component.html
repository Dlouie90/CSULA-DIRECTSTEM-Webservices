        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The purpose of the Visualization Tool for Composition of Cloud Computing Services (VTCCCS) is to develop a
            software tool to support the composition of cloud computing web services. Users will be able to use this
            visualization tool to model the architectures of cloud computing services based systems. The system is
            designed to facilitate the process of tracking and displaying the composition of cloud services and the
            results of these composite services. Potential scenarios include processing satellite data and then passing
            the processed data to another service to analyze.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Visualization Tool for Composition of Cloud Computing Services system is composed of two main
            components: a client-side application which will be served over the web, and a server-side which will
            support and interact with various client-side features. The Visualization Tool has two types of web portals.
            One web portal is used for users to create projects and view relevant information of web services while the
            other web portal is for administrators to manage user information and other details.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are multiple functionalities available to the user to create projects to simulate cloud computing.
            Users will be able to create, save, load, delete, and modify projects. These projects are used to simulate
            cloud computing and views its QoS. Once a user chooses to load or create a new project, they will be taken
            to the View Block. Nodes can be created and displayed in the View Block. The View Block displays the nodes
            depending on the View selected of which the user can choose based on their preference. Users are able to
            obtain metrics about usage of services such as runtime for each service or project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Administrators are met with a different set of functionalities to manage user data obtained from the
            database. Administrators are able to view all, view details, add, edit, or delete users. Administrators are
            able to check the users’ login times, each session length, and average session time. For the session length
            data, administrators are able to view this in list view or graph view. Using the session length data again,
            the administrators are able to view the average session time for each user. Administrators will not be able
            to modify users’ projects or view them. Administrators are only able to manage user data.
